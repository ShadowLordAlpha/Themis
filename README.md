## Overview

A Generics and Lambda based Event framwork for Java.

## Background

While working on several other projects I wanted Event systems. I could have custom coded these event systems and that would have easily been a solution to my problem however this had been a reoccuring problem where I would have liked to be able to use a somewhat simple system as a base for events. Now for that problem there are already a few solutions but I did not want to modify my own classes to be an implementation of their Event or whatever as that is how most other systems I found implement an Event system. Its not a bad system and works well for most things but its far less flexable than something that can just accept any kind of object and use it as an event. This also allows Themis to use other objects that you might not have the ability to modify into a proper event in other systems without needing to needlessly wrap the object with another just to use a system.
